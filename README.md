_Rules for Beep-Boop from the assignment:_

* First, here are the rules of Beep-Boop:

* Numbers that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!".

_The following specs are included in the program:_

* Take a numerical input from user and return all numbers up to that number, replacing numbers according to the above rules.

* Program does nothing to alphabetical characters.
  - Example Input: Let me try to break your code!
  - Example Output: Please enter a number

* Program replaces 0 with "Beep!"
  - Example Input: 0
  - Example Output: ["Beep!"]

* Program replaces 1 with "Boop!"
  - Example Input: 10
  - Example Output: ["Boop!"]

* Program replaces numbers divisible by 3 with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that".
  - Example In: 310
  - Example Out: ["I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that".]

* Program shows all numbers counting up (starting at 0) to input with rules applied.
  - Example In: 4
  - Example Out: "Beep! ", "Boop! ", "2 ", "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. ", "4 "

* Program replaces non-numerical characters on keyup with empty string
  - Example In: A
